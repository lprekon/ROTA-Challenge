# ROTA-Challenge
Challenge by Praetorian
The program plays a game of ROTA, a game similar to tic-tac-toe with the preatorian servers.
The game operates just like tic-tac-toe, except that the outer board is circular, allowing winning moves where there would otherwise be corners, and after all pieces are placed, players take turns moving their pieces.
The goal is not to win, but simply to play without losing for 1 hour.
